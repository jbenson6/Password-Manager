# Password-Manager
Java based password manager. Uses java, javafx, fxml, css, and uses local MySQL database

Need to have MySQL installed, along with the java connector. Create the schema and tables yourself and 
create a user named password_manager in MySQL that can only access password_manager schema. This can be done
in the MySQL Workbench
